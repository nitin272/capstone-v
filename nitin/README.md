Daily task will done my me this week





Creating an app with the features you've outlined requires detailed planning and execution. The following is a proposed daily breakdown to guide your development process over a hypothetical 4-week period. This timeline assumes that you have a foundational understanding of the technologies involved and that each "day" represents a focused work session. Adjust the timeline based on your own pace and availability.

Week 1: Project Setup and Initial Development


Day 1: Project Initialization


1. Initialize the project repository.
2. Set up the project structure (frontend and backend directories).
3. Initialize frontend and backend projects with chosen frameworks (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend).
4. Day 2: Environment and Database Setup
5. Set up development, testing, and production environments.
6. Configure the database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
7. Design and document the initial database schema for users, bookings, hotels, restaurants, attractions, and cultural insights.


Day 3: Authentication

1. Implement user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out) on the backend.
2. Implement user session management (JWT tokens, session cookies).

Day 4: Frontend Setup
1. Set up frontend routing with a navigation bar.
2. Create basic layout components (header, footer).


Day 5: Train Booking Feature - Backend

1. Design and implement API endpoints for train booking (search, book, cancel).
2. Integrate train booking API if using a third-party service.

Day 6: Train Booking Feature - Frontend
1. Develop the UI for train search and booking.
2. Implement frontend logic to consume the backend train booking API.
3. Day 7: Review and Testing
4. Conduct initial testing of the train booking feature.
5. Review the week's progress and plan for Week 2.
6. Week 2: Feature Development
